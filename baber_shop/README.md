<h1 align="center">:barber: Barber-Shop :barber:</h1>
<br>
<p align="center">For this project i only used HTML5, CSS3. The objective of this aplication is to show a barber-shop web page.</p><br>
<p align="center">During this journey I was able to learn and improve:

- Structuring HTML pages, understanding each tag;
- Manipulate text and images;
- Structure and hierarchy of elements in CSS;
- Lists ol ul;
- Inline and block behavior;
- Links, working with maps, youtube videos, fonts and other pages;
- Remove style settings that the browser creates, to be able to work better with the structuring of the page;
- Pseudo-classes;
- Forms, selects and tables;
- Input types (email, tel, password...), adding a placeholder and making the field required;
- Improve the user's visual experience with transition, transform, shadows, opacity, borders...;
- Transition colors;
- Manipulating selectors;

The learning was great, the journey is long and the secret is constancy.</p>

<p align="center">For the next steps i'll work on resonsible adaptations to get this page enable for anyone who wants to check it out by phone</p>
